# 👋 Hi, I'm Rodney Nuñez! 🇩🇴

I'm an **Aspiring Software Developer** with a strong passion for **Software Engineering**, **Data Engineering**, and **Cloud Computing**.

🎓 I'm persuing a **BSc in Computer Science** (expected December 2024) at the **New Jersey Institute of Technology** and I've recently graduated from **Correlation One's DS4A Data Engineering Bootcamp**. 📚

🏢 I most recently worked as a **Software Engineer Intern** at **JPMorgan Chase & Co.**, where my team discovered that the *Next.js* framework’s general optimizations and different rendering techniques can increase the firm’s *React Web Application* First Contentful Paint performance by 50%. The process started with refactoring in-house *React Components* and *Hooks* to ensure compatibility with *Next.js* and testing them via *Storybook*, *Unit Tests* (100% Jest coverage), and *Cypress E2E Testing*. We then created and *Cloud-deployed* one *React* and several *Next.js Web Applications* in order to compare performance after introducing *Server-side Rendering* and *Static Site Generation*.
