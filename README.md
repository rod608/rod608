Recently, I graduated from **Correlation One's DS4A Data Engineering Bootcamp**. 📚

👨‍💻 I am currently working as a **Software Engineer Co-Op** at **HubSpot**, where I’m focused on refactoring legacy components using **Redux** and building tests with **React Testing Library** and **Selenium** to improve application quality.
